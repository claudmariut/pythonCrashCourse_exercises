1. When an error happens, python creates an exception object.
We can tell python what to do when different kind of exception objects happen.

2. We create try-except blocks. And put the code inside the try block. If
python encounters an error, it will run the code inside the except block that
handles that kind of error. If the code works, it will skip the except bloks.

3. We can use a try-except-else block. We place the operation that might causes
error in the try block. Then if the program arises an error in that operation,
it looks after the except block that handles that error and executes that code.
If no error arises, it executes the else block.

4. We can analyze text. The string method .split(), creates a list with each
word separate by a comma or space.

5. The try-except-else block allows the program to keep running after
finding a problem.

6. .count(value) method returns the numbers of appearances of the value in the
list, string, integer, etc...
