1. Reading form a file is useful to analyze data. We can work with information
from a file or even work with one line at a time.

2. open() function ask for an argument, a file to be open in this case. And
returns its content as an object. We can use close() to close the file. But
that can cause bugs. Or the file may be left open. Tha is why we use "with" at
the beginning. Se once, python finishes executing what it ned from the file, it
close it automatically.

3. Read method, stores the content of the file in a long string.

4. We can access file from other paths inside th open() function as an argument.
For instance. If we have a directory called text_files inside the directory in
which you are working. You can do: with open("text_files/filename.txt) as ..."

5. We can access files from other directories using the complete format:
 "/home/claumariut/.../filename.txt"

6. We can read line by line, to find something in a document for example. Using
loops inside. We do not use the .read() method in this case. Because, it would
have converted the file to a big string, returning characters. The object still
returns lines.

7. We can make a list from a file, so once we leave the with block, we still
have access to the content of the file. we use .readlines() method, which

8. We can work with file contents. Transform for example, the big string
formatted in to a single line string. Also, the readlines() method, transforms
the content into a string always. So we have to transform to int() or float().

9. We can user the .replace() method to replace any word in the text. But we
have to store the value again.

10. We can add a second argument to the open() function. 'w' write mode, 'r'
read mode, 'a' append mode. Or 'r+' write and read. By default it is open in
read mode 'r'. The file can be created just from the call function.
