1. The json module allow us to store the data that user enters when they use
our programs. (JavaScript Object Notation). It stores data structures, then
we can load this data structures next time the program runs.

2. We have to import json module to our file. We use json.dump() and
json.load() functions.

3. json.dump() is used to store something into a file. It need two arguments.
A data structure, and a file object where to store it.
The file we use has the extension .json.

4. json.load() is used to load the data from json file. We first declare a
variable, and assign the value of the variable to json.read(f), being 'f' the
file object we opened.
